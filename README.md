# Luxuriant’s efficacy analysis for hair growth

## Abstract
To analyse the effects of Luxuriant for treating male pattern baldness, we have conducted a trial with 4 groups, with patients suffering from baldness. Three of the groups were given a specific brand’s treatment: Luxuriant, BaldBeGone and SkinheadnNoMore, and the 4th group was the placebo group. The results of this trial show that, although the Luxuriant group showed significantly more growth than the placebo group, the rivals BaldBeGone and SkinheadNoMore heavily outperform our product.

## Introduction

A clinical trial was conducted, for the purpose of testing Luxuriant’s efficacy for treating male pattern baldness. The trial consisted of patients suffering from male pattern baldness, divided into 4 groups, each treated with one of the three brands, Luxuriant, BaldBeGone and SkinheadNoMore or the placebo group with no effective treatment. All the participants were shaved, then measured for their hair growth after a month.
The study’s research questions were:
1. Is Luxuriant causing growth?
2. How does Luxuriant’s effectiveness compares with other brands? 
3. Does age effect hair growth?

## Conclusions
The trial conducted showed that Luxuriant is an effective treatment, causing hair growth among its users. However, it is not as effective as its competitors, BaldBeGone and SkinheadNoMore. BaldBeGone is the most effective for hair growth in the market. The goal of the company with this product should be to be increase the efficacy of our product beyond the level of BaldBeGone. This requires a lot of improvement as it caused 17.4 mm more hair growth. The 2nd best was SkinheadNoMore, having 5.741 mm more hair growth per month than our product. Our initial target should be to at least make our product more effective than SkinheadNomore, before pursuing the final goal, becoming the most effective product providers.
